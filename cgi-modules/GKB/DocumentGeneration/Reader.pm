=head1 NAME

GKB::DocumentGeneration::Reader

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Takes some kind of input info and presents it in a text-generation-friendly way.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gets assorted book-related information and presents it in a form
that is friendly for document generation, especially book generation.
The "output" from this clas comes in the form of a stream of TextUnit
objects, which encapsulate things like section headers, paragraphs,
etc.

The input could come, for example, from a database, or from a
website, or from a document.

This is intended to be the superclass for any Reader class that you implement.
It supplies a whole bunch of get_* methods that classes inheriting from
GenerateText might use.  There's only one method you really *must* implement
yourself, and that's get_next_text_unit.  This method pulls a TextUnit
object from whatever you are using as an input stream.  The idea is, you
generate a sequence of TextUnit objects representing the parts of the
book, which are then passed on to a GenerateText object to be emited to
an appropriate output stream, e.g. a PDF file.
