=head1 NAME

GKB::AddLinks::Director

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The main purpose of this class is to put links into the Reactome
database, pointing to external databases.  It uses objects subclassed
from the Builder base class to do this, by running their "buildPart"
methods.

Use the "add_builder" method to tell it which Builder objects to
use.

Use the "construct" method to run the "buildPart" of the Builder
objects.

It has a number of setter methods that allow you to pass things
like database parameters onto the individual Builder objects.

It forms part of the Builder design pattern.
