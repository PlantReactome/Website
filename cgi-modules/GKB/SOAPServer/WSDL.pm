=head1 NAME

GKB::SOAPServer::WSDL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Sets up a SOAP server based on a WSDL file, and provides a couple of utility methods.

This class is intended to be extended by more complex classes, tailored
to specific services.

Classes inheriting from this class
*must* pass their wsdl as an argument to this class' constructor.
